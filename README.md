# Airport Check-In Counter System

## Objetive

This project involves the development of a thread-safe remote system for the allocation of airport check-in counters. The system allows notifying airlines and providing reports on check-ins performed up to the current moment. It addresses the fundamental aspects of the check-in counter assignment process from the perspectives of passengers, airlines, and airport administration.
